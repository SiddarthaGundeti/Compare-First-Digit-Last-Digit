# Compare-First-Digit-Last-Digit

Question Explanation:

This program is designed to compare specific digits of two three-digit numbers A and B:

It checks if the first digit of A is less than the last digit of B.
Logical Approach:

Read Input:
Read two three-digit numbers A and B. Both A and B are input as strings.

Extract First Digit of A:
Retrieve the first digit of the number A by accessing its first character and converting it to an integer.

Extract Last Digit of B:
Retrieve the last digit of the number B by accessing its last character and converting it to an integer.

Compare the Digits:
Compare the first digit of A with the last digit of B to see if the first is less than the latter.

Output:
Print True if the first digit of A is less than the last digit of B. Otherwise, print False.

Example for Clarity:

Consider A = 123 and B = 378:
The first digit of A (1) is less than the last digit of B (8), so the output is True.
Consider A = 215 and B = 572:
The first digit of A (2) is not less than the last digit of B (2), so the output is False.
The output will be either True or False based on the comparison.
